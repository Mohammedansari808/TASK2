DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WINDOW AND DOCUMENT 

                                            DOCUMENT
                 WINDOW      +     {HTML FILE [PHP,URL,COOKIES,]} -------->  window.document.{property}
                                Document gets loaded in window object

WINDOW:
1. Window object represents an open window in a browser. 
2.This window object has the majority of the properties like length,
    innerWidth, innerHeight,etc
3. Browser has responsibilities to expose alerts 
4. if we are working with alerts that can be found only in the window object  not in the
    document object
5. If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object
    for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

    WINDOW OBJECT METHOD EXAMPLES:

    alert()                :     Displays an alert box with a message and an OK button
    clearInterval()   :	Clears a timer set with setInterval()
    clearTimeout()  :	Clears a timer set with setTimeout()
    
    PROPERTIES OF WINDOW EXAMPLES:

    screen :	Gives the Screen object for the window               
    location:Gives the Location object for the window.
    name    :Sets or returns the name of a window

DOCUMENT OBJECT:
1. The document is the actual html file whenever it communicates with the 
    server.So ,a html file becomes into a document object.
2. The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will
    be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the 
    window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie. 
3. The document object is a property of the window object.
4. It is nested inside the window object
5. To find in the document we use document. , if we call window.document it prints the 
    same as the document. prints
    EXAMPLE:
                   let link = document.URL
                   let link = window.document.URL
   These two commands are same which gives the same link
